# Section 11: Changing Pages with Routing

This is an app previously build by the course instructor, this sections will show on how Routing
works. Up until now I was doing everything in the same page by showing and hiding elements.

For this section I'm going to use a project provided by te instructor, and I'll implement
the navigation of the components by implementing a routing.

## Sections

The course sections / lessons will be organized as commits, for instance:
The Section 2: The Basics will be
```
  "[section number] : [lesson number and title]"
  
  OR
  
  "[section number and name]"
```
