# Section 27: Service Workers

In this Module we'll look into Angular Service Workers to add Offline capabilities to an Angular
project.

A Service Worker is like a WebWorker, it runs in a separated thread from main JS, and it can be used
to intercept our requests and cache them.

To enable this feature in our project, we can run the command
```
    ng add @angular/pwa
```
## Sections

The course sections / lessons will be organized as commits, for instance:
The Section 2: The Basics will be
```
  "[section number] : [lesson number and title]"
  
  OR
  
  "[section number and name]"
```
