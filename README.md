# Section 5: Components & Databinding

This is an app previously build by the course instructor, here we'll explore how to send data through components and so on.

It follows the same structure as the previous sections.

## Sections

The course sections / lessons will be organized as commits, for instance:
The Section 2: The Basics will be
```
  "[section number] : [lesson number and title]"
  
  OR
  
  "[section number and name]"
```

![Components Lifecycle](./component-lifecycle.png?raw=true "Component Lifecycle")
