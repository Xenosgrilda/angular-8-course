This is the repository for my Angular 8 course, it will have all the projects developed in this course organized by commits

For general instructions, such as installing or configuration something, you can find it into the "readme.md" of each project.

The course sections / lessons will be organized as commits, for instance:
The Section 2: The Basics will be
```

  OR
  
  "[section number and name]"
```

to Angular recognizes it, we need to specify it into 'angular.json' file:
