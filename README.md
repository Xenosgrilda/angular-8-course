# Section 15: Assignment 6

This project is for the Assignment 6 of this course: Build a form using 
the Template Driven approach.

## Tasks
 * Mail address (should not be empty and should be an email address)
 * A Dropdown which allows the user to select from three different Subscriptions ("Basic", "Advanced", "Pro")
   * Set "Advanced" as Default
 * A Password field (should not be empty)
 * A Submit Button

 * Display a warning message if the Form is invalid AND was touched. Display a warning message below each input if it's invalid.

 *  Upon submitting the form, you should simply print the Value of the Form to the Console.
   Optionally, display it in your template.

## Sections

The course sections / lessons will be organized as commits, for instance:
The Section 2: The Basics will be
```
  "[section number] : [lesson number and title]"
  
  OR
  
  "[section number and name]"
```
