<!-- The form "action" should not be defined, because, Angular will take care of this form. This form should not
 be submitted to a server.

 With the "FormsModule" imported in our module. Angular will automatically create a JS representation of the form
 whenever it finds the <form> element in html. Even though, we still need to tell Angular which inputs or "controls"
 are to be registered manually. By control I mean, what inputs Angular should care.
 -->

<!--
 To register which input we want to have mapped, we just need to add the ngModel directive!
    ngModel name="nameOfControl"

 To be able to retrieve the Submit action via Angular we can attach the (ngSubmit) to the <form> Element.
-->

<!--
  To retrieve the form data object that Angular has made, we need to do a peculiar thing, add a template reference to
  the form and assign to it to "ngForm". This will capture the object exposed by this form element which is a directive,
  when we add FormsModule.
    (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(f)" #f="ngForm"
-->

<!--
  Validations
  Since we're using a Template Driven approach, our validations should be on template...
  We can use HTML validators, and they will act as selectors for Directives built in Angular.

  Angular also provides some additional directives such as "email" (used above).
  If validation don't pass Angular will update the form value and also each form controller. It'll also add classes to
  those controllers.
