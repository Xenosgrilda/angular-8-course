<!-- We could bind a property just like we've bound the property directive, for COMPONENTS, when we pass a property we're actually passing data
     To its visible (@input) fields/properties.
     basically what we're doing is:
     We're setting the property "element" of our component to the value of "serverElement" which is an array in app.component (serverElements)
