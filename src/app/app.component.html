<!-- The form "action" should not be defined, because, Angular will take care of this form. This form should not
 be submitted to a server.

 With the "FormsModule" imported in our module. Angular will automatically create a JS representation of the form
 whenever it finds the <form> element in html. Even though, we still need to tell Angular which inputs or "controls"
 are to be registered manually. By control I mean, what inputs Angular should care.
 -->

<!--
 To register which input we want to have mapped, we just need to add the ngModel directive!
    ngModel name="nameOfControl"

 To be able to retrieve the Submit action via Angular we can attach the (ngSubmit) to the <form> Element.
-->

<!--
  To retrieve the form data object that Angular has made, we need to do a peculiar thing, add a template reference to
  the form and assign to it to "ngForm". This will capture the object exposed by this form element which is a directive,
  when we add FormsModule.
    (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(f)" #f="ngForm"
-->

<!--
  There's another way to retrieve the form, since we're getting a template reference "#f" we can access it via
  @ViwChild
  This is useful when we need access to form at a time before submitting it
-->
