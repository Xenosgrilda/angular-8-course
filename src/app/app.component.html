<!--
 To register which input we want to have mapped, we just need to add the ngModel directive!
    ngModel name="nameOfControl"

 To be able to retrieve the Submit action via Angular we can attach the (ngSubmit) to the <form> Element.
-->

<!--
  To retrieve the form data object that Angular has made, we need to do a peculiar thing, add a template reference to
  the form and assign to it to "ngForm". This will capture the object exposed by this form element which is a directive,
  when we add FormsModule.
    (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(f)" #f="ngForm"
-->

<!--
  Validations
  Since we're using a Template Driven approach, our validations should be on template...
  We can use HTML validators, and they will act as selectors for Directives built in Angular.

  Angular also provides some additional directives such as "email" (used above).
  If validation don't pass Angular will update the form value and also each form controller. It'll also add classes to
  those controllers.
 -->

<!--
  Here we're disabling the 'submit' <button> if the form 'f' (which we have access to the form object provided by
  FormsModule) has any error.

  Also, since Angular add some classes depending on the control state (invalid = ngInvalid, touched = ngTouched) we can
  take advantage on that and add styling

  And if we wanted to get a specific input? In the same way angular expose the form information as a template reference:
    #f="ngForm"

  We can do the same with a control(input), but for that, we don't want to expose the whole form just the control
  element, to do so:
    <input ngModel required email #emailEl="ngModel"
           name="email" class="u-full-width" type="email" placeholder="someguy@somth.com" id="email">
    <p *ngIf="emailEl.touched && emailEl.invalid" class="form-error">...</p>
