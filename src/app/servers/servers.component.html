  "If Else" structure: We can achieve this in Angular by creating a <ng-template> which is a component directive shipped with Angular
   - Syntax: {
    <element class"..." *ngIf="[expression]; else [theMark]"> True output </element> "

    <ng-template #theMark>
      <element class="..."> False output </element>
    </ng-template>
   }

  Directives: At a high level, directives are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, comment or CSS class)
  that tell AngularJS's HTML compiler ($compile) to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element (e.g. via event listeners)
  or even to transform the DOM element and its children.

  AngularJS comes with a set of these directives built-in, like ngBind, ngModel, and ngClass. Much like you create controllers and services,
  you can create your own directives for AngularJS to use. When AngularJS bootstraps your application,
  the HTML compiler traverses the DOM matching directives against the DOM elements.



  There are three kinds of directives in Angular:

    1) Components—directives with a template.
    2) Structural directives—change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements.
    3) Attribute directives—change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive.

    Components are the most common of the three directives. You saw a component for the first time in the Getting Started tutorial.

    Structural Directives change the structure of the view. Two examples are NgFor and NgIf. Learn about them in the Structural Directives guide.

    Attribute directives are used as attributes of elements. The built-in NgStyle directive in the Template Syntax guide, for example, can change several element styles at the same time.
