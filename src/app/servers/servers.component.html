<!--
  Creating a routerlink for servers, so we can use our query parameters
-->

<!--
  To pass Query Parameters we can use the queryParams property, which is a bindable property of the routerLink
  directive.
  note that we're passing using the routerLink array.
  Imagine if we wanted to have a query parameter that we would use to check if it's allowed to change the server or
  not... For that we could use a property of the routerLink Directive: [queryParams]

  [queryParams] receives a Js object with the key values pairs of the URL query params.

  Remembering that this is for defining properties of the routerLink directive to a LINK, to build this queryParams

  We could also add a fragment by using the "fragment / [fragment] property to the url

  Now, to do everything above programmatically check home.component.ts

<!--
  Setting up Child (Nested) Routes

  So here we we're facing a problem, after we refactor our routes array, our child routes were not loading anymore.
  Because we're using one <router-outlet> which was being used by the servers, so we need to actually add another
  for the children
